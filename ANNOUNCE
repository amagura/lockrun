Option -m added.
Option -v can be given twice.
Minor cosmetic changes like usage pattern corrected for "Invoke shell script only once".

Note that you would want to lock for the shell script's name
(like presented in the usage) and not for some MAGIC.
Also note that locking a shell script often does not
work, as some shells do not like to run locked files.

Option -v now can be more verbose (only in combination with option -u).
Option -m changes the return code in case the error comes from lockrun
and not the forked child.
