Option -i makes lockrun return success even if the lock could not aquired and the cmd was not run.

Use this if you desparately need the return value of your cmd and not being able to aquire a lock is no failure (i. e. because something else is processing).
Please note lockrun still returns a non-success value for other type of errors (like disk write error).

For example "lockrun -ni .lock false" now returns 0 (success) if lock cannot be aquired and 1 (false) if the file was lockable.
So it now is (vastly) the opposite of "lockrun -n .lock true".  Both will fail if, for example, the current directory is not writeable.
(Note that the lock is only held while the command runs.)
