This opens a file, places a lock on the file, and if obtained, runs
some other program.  If this program terminates, the lock is removed.

If there already is a lock on the file, it waits for the lock to be aquired.
With option -n it does not wait for the lock and instead returns false.

To remove the lockfile, you can do 'lockrun "file" rm -f "file"'.
