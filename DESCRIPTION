This here was done before I got aware of "lckdo" from the debian
package "moreutils".  It has some different options, though:

Lockrun opens or creates a file, places a lock on the file, and if obtained,
runs some other program.  If the program terminates, the lock is removed.

If there already is a lock on the file, it waits for the lock to be aquired.
With option -n it does not wait for the lock and instead returns false.

With option -u a lockfile can be created which is safely removed after it
is no more needed (this option is experimental).  To remove a locked file
use something like 'lockrun "file" rm -f "file"'.
