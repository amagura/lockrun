There is a similar Debian package "lckdo" which has some different features.

Lockrun opens or creates a file, places a lock on the file, and if obtained,
runs some other program.  If the program terminates, the lock is removed.

If there already is a lock on the file, it waits for the lock to be aquired.
With option -n it does not wait for the lock and instead returns false
or true in case option -i is used.

With option -u a lockfile can be created which is safely removed after it
is no more needed (this option is experimental).  To safely remove such a
locked file after crashes you can use 'lockrun -vvu "file" true'.
